**OBJECTIVES**

Analyze the patterns in bike renting and sharing, providing insights into how rentals vary on a monthly, daily, hourly, and half-hourly basis.

Examine the influence of weather on bike rentals. Determine whether all weather conditions affect bike rental rates and identify the factors that most significantly impact rental patterns.

Using the available data, recommend three rental locations where an advertiser should place ads for a two-month period by identifying which stations or rental points would ensure maximum visibility to the highest number of users.

**SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS**
Bike rental activity showed a consistent increase throughout the year, with January having the lowest activity and May the highest. Analysis of hourly rental data revealed that most bike rentals occurred between 15:00 and 18:00, peaking at 17:00/17:30.
Weather conditions significantly influenced bike rental patterns, as it common for people to be less inclined to rent bikes in unfavourable weather conditions. Temperature and humidity were key factors affecting rentals. The average temperature had a positive correlation with bike rentals, with the coldest month (January) seeing the fewest rentals, and the warmest month (May) recording the highest. This trend is logical as people are more inclined to rent bikes in warmer weather. On the other hand, humidity negatively impacted bike rentals, with fewer rentals on more humid days. The peak rental time (17:00) consistently had the lowest humidity and highest temperature, underscoring the influence of these weather factors.

Seasonal patterns showed that as the year progressed, humidity, snow, and fog decreased, which is typical for warmer months. This reduction contributed to increased bike rentals. Rainfall also had a noticeable effect, with days of significant rain showing reduced rental activity. Given the strong influence of temperature and humidity, rental patterns are likely to differ in summer, characterized by higher temperatures and lower humidity. An annual dataset would provide more comprehensive insights, helping MOL Bubi better prepare for future years.

For advertisement placement, identifying the most frequently used stations is imporatnt. Margitsziget, Kálvin tér, and Erzsébet tér emerged as the busiest stations in terms of rental activity, making them prime locations for advertisements to maximize visibility. Additionally, bike routes can offer opportunities for targeted marketing. Local businesses, such as cafes, ice cream shops, and snack bars, could use this information to attract customers who frequently use these bike routes.
